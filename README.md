# Notes from the Lecture
## Introduction and Data Mining Workflow
* 90% of the data that exists is created in the last two years - therefore also called the age of datafication.
* *R* is a language, *RStudio* is a writing software, *tidyverse* is a set of R packages.
* Data Science can be split in a few basic steps: data mining > data wrangling > statistical analysis > output
    * data mining: getting the data interacting with the internet
    * data wrangling: transform data into tidy data
    * statistical analysis: analyse the data and find new insights
    * output: communicate the information

### Elements of Data Mining
* Technologies for dissemating content on the web
* **Technologies for information extraction**
* Technologies for data storage

### Basics in R
* the pipe makes the code more readable.
* use a project oriented workflow.
* use folders to create a structure and good names for files. The name gives an idea about what the code will do.
* avoid point-and-click.

## Web Scraping
* A regular expression is a sequence of characters that specifies a match pattern in text.
